  <!-- The website Area None is a storytelling puzzle game based on the idea of the multiverse. The game is an individual 
    universe that contains many small worlds (with different levels), and each level tells a unique story to the user. 
    The user will use puzzles to create various objects in the story to explore the world. 

My goal for this website is to create a game that catches the users’ interest in the long term, it is easy, time-killing 
and engaging. Super Jigsaw Puzzle: Generations is the base of my idea. This game is an ordinary online puzzle game that 
provides different puzzles for the users to choose from, once the user finishes the puzzle the puzzle lines disappear and 
turn into an image. There are no other elements in this game, which might cause a quick novelty loss for users. The visual 
style of Super Jigsaw is not as trendy, it is difficult to attract young adults’ attention.

Meanwhile, the game Woodo has jumped out of 2-dimensional space and made their puzzle 3-dimensional to follow the current 
trend. The colour scheme is warm and peaceful, allowing the user to relax during the busy lifestyle. Unlike the Super Jigsaw, 
Woodo contains more storytelling, and the art style remains consistent throughout the game. The consistency in visual style 
makes the game more visually appealing.

The game’s visual style is inspired by the game Good Pizza Great Pizza, the hand-drawn style and warm colour pallet are visually 
relaxing to the user. It gives the user a sense of peacefulness. The hand-drawn style mainly shows the broken outlines but considering 
other elements in the game puzzle pieces will be displayed with normal outlines but maintaining the warm colour scheme. 

The website contains a popup window before the games start, the window tells the user the story, aim and a start button 
to make sure the user reads the story before starting the game. 

The Seymour One font is used for headings, the uneven line width adds a sense of playfulness to the game.
During the production of the website, the drag-and-drop action was the most difficult one to write as images are used instead 
of shapes. Many tries and errors happened during that stage. Merging the three puzzles was a challenge too. At first, I tried 
to start the merge action once the user had completed the puzzle, but it didn’t work. In the end, l chooses to create a finish 
button to start the merge action. The merge location was a problem too, l tried many methods, but the elements are still off the 
place a bit in the y-axis, and I was struggling with it. 

The website only shows one of the levels of the game. The game as a whole contains many levels like this with a unique story, 
the level of difficulty will increase as the story goes towards the end. As each story is individual there will be no worries for 
the game to have an end, so the player can keep playing but still have novelty.  Instead of the written story, an anime or a short 
video clip could be added to tell the story too. The style for the game can be improved in the future, a light-coloured illustration 
can be used as the background instead of a solid colour to add more texture to the visual. The layout of the puzzle can be changed at 
each level according to the story. The location of the elements can be more accurate for a better visual experience.
